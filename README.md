# Recommendation Systems for User Well-Being

This repository contains the code developed for the **Recommendation Systems** project focused on **user well-being**, using multi-objective optimization that integrates:

- **Accuracy** (Hit Rate)
- **Diversity**
- **Novelty**
- **Serendipity**
- **Fairness**

The goal is to study the trade-off between engagement and well-being, using normalized metrics and various weight combinations to analyze how the recommender's behavior changes.

The project is built on the original repository of the Recommender Systems course at Politecnico di Milano, developed by **Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema**.
